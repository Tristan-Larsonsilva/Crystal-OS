# Crystal-OS
I am working on a operating system for a vm
Called Crystal-OS 
Its a linux distro built for all purposes such as... 
Art, Programming, Hacking, Gaming, Everyday use, and some more 
I will convert it to a iso later on
It is built off of ubuntu linux 




# Why did you make this? 
because its fun go get a life
